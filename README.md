List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1.Planning and Requirement Analysis- involves gathering, analyzing, and defining project            requirements, assessing feasibility, and creating a structured plan to ensure successful          execution.
  2. Defining Requirements-all the requirements for the target software are specified and       
     approved.
  3.Designing Architecture- involves developing both low level and high level designs and 
    choosing the most practical and logical design.
  4.Developing Product-he fundamental development of the product starts,programming tools and 
    programming languages are used.
  5.Product Testing and Integration-at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and 
    retested.
  6.Deployment and Maintenance of Products- it is releaesd in the real industrial environment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**COMPARISON**
Both provide structured approaches to software development.
Both aim to deliver a functional and high-quality software product.
Both have testing processes to ensure software quality, though Agile tests continuously
 Both involve teamwork among developers, testers, and stakeholders.
 
** CONTRAST**
 
-Approach: Waterfall follows a linear process, while Agile is iterative and flexible.
-Flexibility: Waterfall resists changes, while Agile adapts easily.
-Client Involvement: Waterfall involves clients mainly at the start and end, while Agile engages 
 them continuously.
-Testing Process: Waterfall tests after development, while Agile tests throughout.
-Delivery Time: Waterfall delivers the final product at the end, while Agile delivers in - 
 increments.
-Project Suitability: Waterfall suits stable projects, while Agile suits dynamic ones.

 **EXAMPLES**
 -Waterfall:Developing an aircraft control system where strict regulations require detailed 
  upfront planning.Developing a banking system.
 -Agile: Building a social media app where user feedback continuously shapes new features.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**SOFTWARE DEVELOPER**
-Developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
-Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
-Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practices when developing software.
-Report to the project manager about the progress of the software development.  

**QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER**
-Collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
-Create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow. 
-Confirm that the software meets the requirements before deployment.
-Analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
-Develop and execute automation scripts using open-source tools. 


**PROJECT MANAGER**
-Discuss the project and its requirements with clients and software developers.
-Assemble and lead the software development team.
-Create the blueprint for the project, including the scope, allocating resources, setting 
 deadlines and laying out communication strategies.
-Supervising each stage of the software development project.
-Set the budget and ensure the project adheres to it as closely as possible.
-Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestones, deliverables and change 
 requests.
-Deliver the completed software to the client and regularly check its performance. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

** Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Importance:**

-Provide a comprehensive workspace with code editing, debugging, and compilation tools.
-Improve productivity with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection.
-Facilitate seamless integration with frameworks, libraries, and version control systems.

**Examples:**

-Visual Studio Code – Lightweight and highly customizable with extensions.
-IntelliJ IDEA – Popular for Java development with smart coding assistance.

**2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
Importance:**

-Track and manage changes in code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently.
-Enable rollback to previous versions, preventing data loss from errors.
-Support branching and merging for parallel development without conflicts.

**Examples:**

-Git – Widely used distributed VCS, often paired with GitHub or GitLab.
-Apache Subversion (SVN) – Centralized VCS used for managing historical changes in code.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Debugging issues- use debugging tools.
2.Meeting project deadlines- use agile methodologies, prioritization and time management 
 techniques.
3.Keeping up with new technologies- continuous learning and social media.
4.Handling Changing Requirements - se flexible methodologies like Agile.
5.Collaboration in Large Teams- use version control systems eg git and collab tools eg jira.
6.Ensuring software security-Follow secure coding practices, conduct regular security audits, 
  and use encryption techniques.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1.unit tests-They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, 
 components, or modules used by your software.
2.integration-Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your 
 application work well together.   
3.functional- focus on the business requirements of an application. They only verify the output 
 of an action and do not check the intermediate states of the system when performing that 
 action. 
4.acceptance - Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.


**importances**
  - Ensures Software Quality: Identifies bugs and defects before deployment, ensuring a stable 
    product.  
- Enhances Security: Detects vulnerabilities to protect against cyber threats and data breaches.  
- Improves Performance: Helps optimize speed, efficiency, and resource utilization.  
- Reduces Development Costs: Fixing issues early prevents costly post-release fixes.  
- Boosts Customer Satisfaction: Ensures a smooth user experience, leading to higher trust and 
   adoption.  
- Facilitates Compliance: Ensures the software meets industry standards and legal requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the process of writing, refining and optimizing inputs to encourage generative AI systems to create specific, high-quality outputs.**


**importance**
-Enhances AI Accuracy: Well-structured prompts improve the relevance and precision of AI- 
 generated responses.
-Optimizes AI Efficiency: Reduces processing time and computational costs by guiding AI 
 effectively.
-Improves User Experience: Helps generate clear, useful, and context-aware responses tailored to 
 user needs.
-Enables Customization: Allows fine-tuning AI models for specific applications like chatbots, 
 coding, or creative writing.
-Boosts Productivity: Automates complex tasks by providing well-crafted prompts, saving time and 
 effort.
-Facilitates AI Alignment: Ensures AI-generated outputs align with ethical, legal, and business 
 requirements.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague-generate a picture of a woman
clear- generate a picure of a young black woman in her 20's coding in her laptop.

-The clear one gives more refined output and that that suits my needs.
